# extman

Package Manager for External Packages...

`extman` is designed for install packages outside from main package servers, keep track of changes, update packages and etc.

The reason why I decided to make another package manager is...

- Some packages are not available in the main distro servers or not maintained by the community and etc.

- And for automating the same process: if the maintainer released a binary package, you need to download and install it manually.

This is exactly why I am developing the `extman`.
